ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Modeling with XGBoost and Optuna
This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit default risk â€” a critical problem in financial institutions. We use XGBoost, a high-performance gradient boosting algorithm, along with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. The dataset contains information on loan applicants and whether they defaulted, and the model predicts creditworthiness based on these features.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The notebook walks through a complete ML pipeline:

Data Preprocessing

Missing value handling

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Handling Imbalanced Classes

Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset

Ensures the model does not favor the majority class

Modeling with XGBoost

Uses XGBClassifier from the XGBoost library

Well-suited for tabular data and imbalanced classification tasks

Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna

Automates tuning of critical parameters like max_depth, eta, gamma, etc.

Objective is to maximize the macro F1-score using cross-validation

Evaluation

Uses cross_val_score for robust evaluation

Tracks performance across trials to find optimal hyperparameters
