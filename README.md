# Credit-Risk-Prediction
This project builds a robust credit risk classification model using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost classifier. The notebook walks through a complete end-to-end pipeline â€” from preprocessing and SMOTE-based class balancing to hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. The goal is to predict the likelihood of loan default.
